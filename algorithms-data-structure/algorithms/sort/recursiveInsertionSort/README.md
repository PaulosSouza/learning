# Recursive insertion sort

## Explanation
- Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good
question to check one's understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion.
- If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm, we keep processed elements sorted and
insert new elements one by one in the sorted array.

## Algorithm (step by step if exists)

### Step 1
Base case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return

### Step 2
Recursively sort first n-1 elements.

### Step 3
Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array
