# Insert Sort

## Explanation
- This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
- Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
- Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted

## Algorithm 

### Step 1
Iterate from arr[1] to arr[N] over the array.

### Step 2
Compare the current element(key) to its predecessor.

### Step 3
If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before.
Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
