# Linked List

## Explanation
* Linked list is a linear data structure.
* The elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
They includes a series of connected nodes which each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

## Representation
* A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head.
* If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL.
* Each node in a list consists of at least two parts.

### Part 1
A Data Item (we can store integer, strings or any type of data)

### Part 2
Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or an address of another node
